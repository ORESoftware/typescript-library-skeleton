## TSLS - TypeScript Library Skeleton

####  Your Project Readme Goes Here

This skeleton project is designed for TS/Node.js libraries, SDKs, and applications.

<br>

### To do things the simple way:

Steps to making this project skeleton your own project base.

1. Clone this repo: <br>
    `git clone https://github.com/ORESoftware/typescript-library-skeleton.git YOUR-PROJECT-NAME`
2. Update package.json so that `name` property matches `<YOUR-PROJECT-NAME>`.
3. Update other package.json fields so that they are accurate.

To check to see if `YOUR-PROJECT-NAME` is available on NPM, uses this command at the command line:

`$ npm view YOUR-PROJECT-NAME`  # will give you a 404 if the name is available.

Of course you can use Github or other hosting platforms instead of NPM to deliver your library.


### This project skeleton uses:

* the correct semver initial value (npm init defaults to 1.0.0 which is just wrong).
* typescript version 3.4.5
* nodejs version 12
* travis/circleci (for automated testing of your library)
* MIT license
* good simple default settings for .gitignore / .npmignore / .editorconfig / .gitattributes
* Transpiling from src to dist folders (by default; you can change it manually)
