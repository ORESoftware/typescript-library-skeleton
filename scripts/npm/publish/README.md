### Don't use np from sindresorhus

First of all, that guy is a douche.
Simple evidence of his douchiness, is that `np` should be pure bash,
not node.js code.

Here we have bash solutions for publishing to NPM and creating matching
git tags, and pushing the corresponding tag to your git remote.

You can alter these bash scripts as you please, on a per project basis,
which is the right way to about it.
