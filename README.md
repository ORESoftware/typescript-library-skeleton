# Your Project Readme Goes Here

This project is used by:
https://github.com/oresoftware/ts-project
You can use ts-project to do things more automatically.

To do things more manually, continue on.

Steps to making this project skeleton your own project base.

1. Clone this repo: <br>
    `git clone https://github.com/ORESoftware/typescript-library-skeleton.git YOUR-PROJECT-NAME`
2. Update package.json so that `name` property matches `YOUR-PROJECT-NAME`.
3. Update other package.json fields so that they are accurate.

To check to see if `YOUR-PROJECT-NAME` is available on NPM, uses this command at the command line:

`$ npm view YOUR-PROJECT-NAME`  # will give you a 404 if the name is available.


### This project skeleton uses:

* the correct semver initial value (npm init defaults to 1.0.0 which is just wrong).
* typescript 2.x
* nodejs version 9
* travis (for automated testing of your library)
* MIT license
* good simple default settings for .gitignore / .npmignore / .editorconfig / .gitattributes



To compile your *.ts files to a dist directory (keeps your source and target files separate),
<br>
simply add this to tsconfig.json:


```json
"compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "dist"
}
```

and

```json
 "include": [
    "src"
  ]
```

For small libraries with a couple of files, I find that using a dist folder (target directory) is more trouble
than it's worth. For projects with just one .ts/.js file, you can just get rid of the lib folder, and put your index.ts
file in the root of the project. In that case, make sure to change the `main` property in package.json from 'lib/index.js' to
'index.js'. Same with the `typings/types` properties.
